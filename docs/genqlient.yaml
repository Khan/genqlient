# Set to the fully-qualified name of a Go type which generated helpers
# should accept and use as the context.Context for HTTP requests.

# Defaults to context.Context; set to "-" to omit context entirely (i.e.
# use context.Background()).  Must be a type which implements
# context.Context.
context_type: context.Context

# If set, a function to get a graphql.Client, perhaps from the context.
# By default, the client must be passed explicitly to each genqlient
# generated query-helper.
#
# This is useful if you have a shared client, either a global, or
# available from context, and don't want to pass it explicitly.  In this
# case the signature of the genqlient-generated helpers will omit the
# `graphql.Context` and they will call this function instead.
#
# Must be the fully-qualified name of a function which accepts a context
# (of the type configured as ContextType (above), which defaults to
# `context.Context`, or a function of no arguments if ContextType is set

# client-getter returns an error, the helper will return the error
# without making a query.

# A map from GraphQL type name to Go fully-qualified type name to override
# the Go type genqlient will use for this GraphQL type.
#
# This is primarily used for custom scalars, or to map builtin scalars to
# a nonstandard type.  By default, builtin scalars are mapped to the
# obvious Go types (String and ID to string, Int to int, Float to float64,
# and Boolean to bool), but this setting will extend or override those
# mappings.
#
# genqlient does not validate these types in any way; they must define
# whatever logic is needed (MarshalJSON/UnmarshalJSON or JSON tags) to
# convert to/from JSON.  For this reason, it's not recommended to use this
# setting to map object, interface, or union types, because nothing
# guarantees that the fields requested in the query match those present in
# the Go type.
#
# To get equivalent behavior in just one query, use @genqlient(bind: ...);
# see genqlient_directive.graphql for more details.
bindings:
  # To bind a scalar:
  DateTime:
    # The fully-qualified name of the Go type to which to bind.  For example:
    #  time.Time
    #  map[string]interface{}
    #  github.com/you/yourpkg/subpkg.MyType
    type: time.Time

  # To bind an object type:
  MyType:
    type: github.com/you/yourpkg.GoType
    # If set, a GraphQL selection which must exactly match the fields
    # requested whenever this type is used.  Only applies if the GraphQL type
    # is a composite output type (object, interface, or union).
    # 
    # This is useful if Type is a struct whose UnmarshalJSON or other methods
    # expect that you requested certain fields.  For example, given the below
    # config, genqlient will reject if you make a query
    #    { fieldOfMytype { id title } }
    # The fields must match exactly, including the ordering: "{ name id }"
    # will be rejected.  But the arguments and directives, if any, need not
    # match.
    # 
    # TODO(benkraft): Also add ExpectIncludesFields and ExpectSubsetOfFields,
    # or something, if you want to say, for example, that you have to request
    # certain fields but others are optional.
